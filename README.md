## Introduction
The objective of the dataset provided in the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship is typically to analyze sales data from retail stores in order to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall store performance. By exploring the dataset, participants are expected to perform tasks such as:

1. Identifying trends and patterns in sales data over time.
2. Comparing the performance of different stores or product categories.
3. Analyzing customer transaction data to understand purchasing behavior between the Trial Stores and Control Stores
4. Implementing statistical analyses to test hypotheses and make data-driven decisions.
5. Creating visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Data Visualization

Utilizing various visualization techniques, the project aims to present a clear and insightful overview of the sales data. This section includes visualizations of trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset.

## Statistical Analysis

### Monthly Sales Experience of Each Store

This section delves into the monthly sales data for each store, providing insights into the variations and trends over time.

### Comparison: Control Stores vs Trial Stores

A comparative analysis between control stores and trial stores, examining key metrics to identify any significant differences in sales performance.

### Pearson Correlation

Utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship between trial and control stores in terms of total sales.

### Hypothesis Statements

- H0: There is a significant relationship between the Trial store and Control stores in terms of Total Sales (i.e., r=0).
- H1: There is a significant relationship between the Trial store and Control stores in terms of Total Sales (i.e., r≠0).

## Total Sales

Analyzing and interpreting the total sales data to gain insights into the overall performance of the stores.

## Average Price Per Unit

Examining the average price per unit across stores, providing insights into pricing strategies and potential impacts on sales.

## Independent Sample t-Test

### Hypothesis

- H0: There is no significant difference between the means of Control stores and Trial store in terms of the (measure). i.e., μi = μj
- H1: There is a significant difference between the means of Control stores and Trial store in terms of the (measure). i.e., μi ≠ μj

## Average Transaction Per Customer

Analyzing the average transaction per customer to understand customer behavior and its influence on sales.

## Conclusion (Task 3)

In the final section, the project concludes by summarizing the findings from the data visualization and statistical analysis. This includes key insights, recommendations, and implications for future actions.

Feel free to explore each section for more details on the analysis and findings.
